# Neural_Net_EOS
A repository for the Python code related to a 2023 masters research thesis on neural networks as equations of state

# TODO:
1. Write up EOS section
2. Write up VLE curve creation section
4. Add L2 regularisation/use AdamW with weight decay
5. Add dropout layers
6. Add derivative properties to the loss fcn
7. Rewrite the loss function to use pytorch MSE
8. Does the MinMax scaler ruin the ability to compute the gradient of the helmholts wrt inputs since its no longer the temperature thats being inputted to the NN 
9. Add learning rate scheduling
