# Neural_Net_EOS
A repository for the Python code related to a 2023 masters research thesis on neural networks as equations of state

# TODO:
1. Write up EOS section
2. Write up VLE curve creation section
3. Write code to coallate data from HPC runs
4. Meet with Erich to discuss datapoint creation rate
    Plot the energy over time for the 4mil datapoints to see when it equilibrates
    Check literature for the timesteps used for data in literature
    Are we going to go over into the VLE region like gustavo suggested or are we going to try to predict the VLE like Erich suggested in the email ?
5. Add isotherms to data creation set
